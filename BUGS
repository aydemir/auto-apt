Bugs, but I'd like to say it's a feature:)

  if you put the directory in PATH, which doesn't exists and
  is provided by some uninstalled package, then the package 
  will be installed unintentionally if non exists program is called.
  So, don't put non-exist dir in your PATH

  suid root process can't be traced by auto-apt. (because of 
  LD_PRELOAD security problems)

  files created by maintainer scripts, that is, files not listed
  in Contents-i386.gz, may be considered as in different package.
  (for examples, files under /usr/share/emacs20/site-lisp/)

  aggregated file are not hit by search (because it weren't recorded in db)

  shell usually has own hash table, so usually uninstalled command
  will be "command not found" instead auto apt-get?
  (zsh try to correct cmd name?)

  can't trace libc internal calls?

Bugs to be fixed:
  Bug#94105: support ssh method

  if package which has interactive maintainer script are installed
  with no tty, it probably won't work.
  => Workaround, if it runs in X environment, apt-get run in
     x-terminal-emulator
     otherwise, if no tty, auto-apt will invoke like: 
          apt-get install pkg </dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1

  detect wrong packages in (in auto-apt debuild)
    usr/lib/perl5/5.6/*
    usr/lib/perl5/File/*
    usr/lib/perl5/IO/*
    usr/share/perl5/File/*
    usr/share/perl5/IO/*

    usr/share/locale/* (in LANG=ja_JP.eucJP)

  missing complete manual page

  auto-apt debuild with fakeroot can't create file with owner root?
